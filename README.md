## About

This application tests the user's understanding of basic coding concepts. The user will be presented with a series of questions and will receive a time penalty against their score with each wrong answer. At the end of the quiz, the user will be given the option of posting their score with their initials, clearing the record of scores, or returning to the previous page to take the quiz again.
